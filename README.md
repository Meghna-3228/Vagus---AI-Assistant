Getting Started
Ready to chat with your very own Vagus AI? Follow these steps to get it running locally.

1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You'll need it to run the server.

2. Installation
First, clone this repository to your machine:

git clone https://github.com/Meghna-3228/Vagus---AI-Assistant.git

cd vagus-ai

Next, you'll need to install the necessary packages for both the client (frontend) and the server (backend).

For the server:

cd server
npm install

3. Configuration
The magic of this app comes from the OpenAI API. You'll need an API key to make it work.

Inside the server folder, create a new file named .env.

Open the .env file and add your OpenAI API key like this:

OPENAI_API_KEY="your_secret_api_key_here"

4. Running the App
You'll need to start both the backend server and the frontend.

Start the server:
From inside the server folder, run:

node server.js

You should see a message saying "Vagus AI server started on http://localhost:5000".

Start the frontend:
Open the index.html file from the root folder in your web browser. You can usually just double-click it!

Now you can start chatting with your AI assistant. Have fun! ðŸŽ‰
